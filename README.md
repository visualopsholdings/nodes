# Nodes

The core subsystem for deliverying the JSON based objects, synchronizing nodes etc.

The Nodes system can be used to implement any "tree" of nodes that want to deliver arbitrary
JSON between them, synchronizing a MongoDB with that JSON:

Core to understanding how this might work you can look at this file which is used
to configure the "schema" that is used to maintain and synchronize objects:

```
[
  {
    "type": "user",
    "internal": true
  },
  {
    "type": "group",
    "internal": true
  },
  {
    "type": "policy",
    "coll": "policies",
    "nosync": true,
    "internal": true
  },
  {
    "type": "collection",
    "subobj": {
      "type": "obj",
      "field": "coll",
      "namefield": "text"
    }
  }
]
```

The "internal" objects are regarded as first class objects in the system and are used
to configure the security of the "collection" and "obj" objects by providing the idea
of editable policies.

A node can have an "upstream" which it communicates with using ECURVE cryptography (ZMQ)
and objects in the "collection" can be markes as "upstream" and then they will be synchronized
between nodes.

Nodes can also be a mirror of another node, and then they will be virtual copies of that node
at all times.

Because everything is implementred using message queuing, this system is perfect to be used in
a "DDIL" environment (Denied, Degraded, Interdicted, and Limited).

The best way to get started is to take a look at:

https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-devops

## ZMQ API

You communicate with Nodes using the ZMQ message queues.

A PUB/SUB socket on port tcp://127.0.0.1:3012.

A REP/REQ socket on port tcp://127.0.0.1:3013.

[Here are the formats for the messages](src/msg/README.md)

## Building

The development process for all of this code used a normal Linux environment with the BOOST
libraries and a C++ compiler.

### Prerequisites

The best way to get started is to take a look at:

https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-devops

And then find your particular OS and run those steps to get a basic binary-only build running 
for your platform. Once you have that you can come back in here and setup all the development
tools you might need.

Ok your back!!!!

This project can be found as the folder "nodes" in the thing you just setup. The next step
is to remove that folder and pull the SOURCE from git with:

```
git clone https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes.git
```

Then depending on your platform, add in necessary development tools:

On Ubuntu 24.04:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install g++ gcc make cmake ruby-rubygems ruby-bundler ruby-dev libssl-dev
```

On the maxc OS:

```
brew install cmake
```

For convenience, do all these inside a folder you can remove, they take a lot of disk space
but aren't used once installed.

```
mkdir working
cd working
```

#### Boost 1.85.0

if you can get this or later with a simple tool then do that, otherwise you will
need to build it from source:

[Instructions](https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-devops/blob/main/dev/BOOST.md)

#### CMake 3.30

if you can get this or later with a simple tool then do that, otherwise you will
need to build it from source:

[Instructions](https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-devops/blob/main/dev/CMAKE.md)

#### ZMQ

If you can get zeromq 4.3.5 or later, then use that otherwise you will need to build it
all from source.

[Instructions](https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-devops/blob/main/dev/ZMQ.md)

#### MongoDB

[Instructions](https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-devops/blob/main/dev/MONGO.md)

### This project

```
git clone https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes.git
nodes/scripts/build.sh
```

To run all the unit tests. And show failures.

```
cd nodes/build
make && make test || cat Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log 
```

## Testing

The end to end tests use cucumber (Ruby), to get that going:

```
bundle install
```

You will only need to do that once to install the ruby stuff.

```
./test.sh
```

For other projects you will need this in your .bashrc or equivalent

```
export NODES_HOME=/where/nodes/went
```

## More complicated tests

You can run tests that build multiple servers and run tests between then with:

```
ci/allnodetests.sh
```

## Testing dependencies

Testing relies on the external project:

https://github.com/visualopsholdings/nodes-test

If this changes, you can fetch it down and rebuild again with:

```
cd build
rm -rf _deps/nodes-test-* && make -j4
```
